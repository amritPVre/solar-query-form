            We respect the privacy of our users and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. This policy describes:

The types of information we may collect or that you may provide when you download, install, register with, access, or use the App.
Our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.
We collect several types of information from and about users of our App, including information:

By which you may be personally identified, such as name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, or any other identifier by which you may be contacted online or offline ("personal information").
That is about you but individually does not identify you, such as the type of solar project you're interested in.
About your internet connection, the equipment you use to access our App, and usage details.
We use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including any personal information:

--To present our App and its contents to you.
--To provide you with information, products, or services that you request from us.
--To fulfill any other purpose for which you provide it.
--To carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us.
--In any other way we may describe when you provide the information.
--For any other purpose with your consent.

We may disclose aggregated information about our users, and information that does not identify any individual, without restriction. We may disclose personal information that we collect or you provide as described in this privacy policy:

--To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it.
--For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.
--With your consent.
We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:

--Tracking Technologies and Advertising. You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent.
--Disclosure of Your Information for Third-Party Advertising. If you do not want us to share your personal information with unaffiliated or non-agent third parties for promotional purposes, you can opt-out by checking the relevant box located on the form where we collect your data.


We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our App, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.

Please note that this is a general template for a privacy policy and may not cover all the legal requirements for your specific situation or jurisdiction. It's important to consult with a legal professional to ensure that your privacy policy is legally sound and comprehensive.
